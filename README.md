# breakout-game
This project was my first encounter with the html canvas and creating games with it. 
I used this tutorial https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

I customized it to make it my own in some way, like adding an autoplayer and compatible controls for mobile devices.
